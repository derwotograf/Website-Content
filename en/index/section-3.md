## Our core believes
<hr class="divider light my-4">

We see ourselves as intersectional environmentalists and believe this to be the only way forward.

##### What Is Intersectional Environmentalism? 
This is an inclusive version of environmentalism that advocates for both the protection of people and the planet.  
It identifies the ways in which injustices happening to marginalized communities and the earth are interconnected.  
It brings injustices done to vulnerable communities, and the earth, to the forefront and does not minimize or silence social inequality.  
**Intersectional environmentalism advocates for justice for people and the planet.**

##### The World is diverse & colourful and one half are women
Overall however, films and television have not been reflecting this reality. Films and programmes, fictional and non-fictional, are characterized by a strong male majority onscreen. Whether itâ€™s talk shows, sports or feature films, the focus is mostly on men: men talk and women listen, men act and women look nice.
NEROPA (TM) was developed by **Belinde Ruth Stieve** as a method to **increase the proportion of women and encourage diversity in film projects onscreen and to sensitize and raise awareness** among those involved.
